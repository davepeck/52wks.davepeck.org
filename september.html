        <p><strong>September 2011 Monthly Wrap-Up</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Musical goal:</strong> bombastic disco/techno</p>
        <p><strong>Technical goal:</strong> kick and bass work together</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I dig Nu Disco. Some of the best Nu Disco is quite subtle. Some of the best Nu Disco isn't subtle at all. I have a lot of trouble doing bombastic stuff that works. So I thought I'd give bombastic over-the-top sounds a hand this month.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Week #36:</strong> This was supposed to be disco-esque but turned out SPROCKET-esque. Oh well.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Week #37:</strong> At D. Dale's request, I wrote this track based on a keyboard figure I was noodling with at jazz practice. It felt good in 5/4. I chose odd timbers to accompany. I like this one.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Week #38:</strong> I feel like this one opens with promise, but the drums are too big and crush any possibility of interest from the track.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Week #39:</strong> Perhaps the only genuinely Nu Disco-sounding thing this month. I started with a handful of wanking disco guitar samples I found lying around. The thing about bombastic Nu Disco is that it still has lots of little details, which this track very much lacks.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Plan for October:</strong> layered, complex, unique</p>
