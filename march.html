        <p><strong>March 2011 Monthly Wrap-Up</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Musical goal:</strong> integrate piano and electronic stuff</p>
        <p><strong>Technical goal:</strong> think hard about mastering</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This month, I wanted to slowly back away from strict piano-based music. I also wanted to spend time getting my mixes to sit -- though I've got a long way to go there, I think.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Week #9:</strong> A holdover from piano-only February, this jazz composition merges the harmonic motion of Wayne Shorter's Speak No Evil with his completely alien Nefertiti. (Nefertiti is technically credited to Davis, but we all know better.) I like what emerged.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Week #10:</strong> This is basically me riffing on Thom Yorke and Radiohead. But I'm pretty sure I need to smoke some before writing stuff like this, because I can't keep it to just one progression.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Week #11:</strong> Back to jazz harmony! A distant piano meets ambient noise from Grand Central Terminal. The harmonic motion is quite strange (though justifications can be made for all changes) and I chose voicings, especially of the ALT chords at the beginning, to emphasize the dissonance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Week #12:</strong> I wanted to do something dark and evil. I originally had a Michael Garson-influenced piano riff for the end, but it never felt quite right. I think the track stands on its own.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Week #13:</strong> The smooth stylings of Danger Dave.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We're one-quarter through the project and the year! <strong>Plan for April:</strong> glitchy ish.</p>
